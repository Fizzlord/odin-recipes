        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Waffles can be made in different shapes and sizes, from round, to square, to rectangular, to even heart shaped. But what they all have in common is that unique honeycomb surface which comes from cooking the batter in a special "waffle" machine (iron). Now the honeycomb pattern (or grid) can be large or small depending on the type of waffle machine you use.</p>

      <p>A "Belgian" waffle is quite thick with a large grid pattern and deep indentations. A "regular" (or standard) waffle is thinner with a smaller grid pattern and therefore more shallow indentations. But no matter which type of waffle you make they all have a bread-like flavor with a crisp outside crust, yet inside they are wonderfully soft and tender. Waffles can be served any time of the day. Excellent for breakfast, brunch, or even as a light supper. They also make a very nice dessert. Ideas for toppings include a pat of butter with a drizzling of maple syrup or honey, jam, fruit sauces, chocolate sauce, and even whipped cream and fresh fruit. </p>
